# Movie-Recommendation-System
 - Recommender system is a type of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item.
 - The system improves the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item or are related to the search history of the user.
 - A movie recommendation system is an automated system that can suggest movies to users based on their preferences.
 
## Types of Recommender System:
- Content-Based Filtering: 
   - Content-based filtering uses a user’s past movie ratings and preferences to recommend similar movies. It looks at the attributes of a movie such as its genre, actors, director, etc. and matches it with the user’s preferences.

- Collaborative Filtering: 
    - Collaborative filtering uses the ratings and preferences of other users to recommend movies. It looks at the ratings of similar users and recommends movies that they have liked and rated highly.

## Problem Statement:
- Using content based filetering, design a Movie recommender system which could recommend similar movies as per Movie genre and movie tags.
- Based on collaborative filtering, design a movie recommender system using Singular value decomposition (SVD).
